## Frequently asked questions 

*When can  I get my certificate and recommendation letter?*
You will get it a week after we conduct the final session - probably 14th December 2021

*Is it must take part in every meeting?*
Although it is not a must for invited talks, we expect your presence at the team presentations and individual discussion dates

*How do you monitor progress?*
Although you will be working as a team of 4-5 members, your work will be individually and collectively assessed - we will use a survey where your team members provide feedback on your work. At the same time, we will have individual interviews/ meetings during the team meetings towards the end of the program.

*What if my team member quit or do not respond in the middle?*
We expect any individual to continue until the end of the program as we made a clear timeline and expectations. However, if there are unprecedented circumstances, we will consider case by case and provide the necessary support to the remaining team members. 

*What if my teamsâ€™ paper does not get accepted to a conference?*
It is totally OK to get the paper rejected, we will optimize based on the feedback of the reviewer and decide the next venue or resubmit to same.

*Can I change my team?* 
We invest a considerable amount of time to decide which team members should work together based on the skills and distribution, therefore we will avoid any individual preferences. We expect you to understand that our decision is final.

*What should be my time commitment?*
Since this will be a collaborative group, your commitment may vary based on your ability to finish certain tasks - read a paper, summarize, write a script to obtain data from a source, clean the data and conduct an analysis etc. Roughly this should not be more than ~1 to 2 hrs per day. However, please note that it all depend on the project/ research questions you will formulate in the group. We will help to scope the project where you will be able to achieve within the timeline.
